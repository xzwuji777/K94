# kalau pakai else, mesti type else: then statement
#instruction lps if yg tkde indent will raise error
# if speed > 44 (count as true), () will be printed. Otherwise if statement is false, nothing is printed
#fahamzz

# and is used to combine conditional statements
#if race > speed and ferrari > race : 
#print ("both statements are true")
# pass
  #patutnya bole print tp tktau knp cannot
  #if can also be written inside other ifs (known as nested if!)
  #if the if statement empty, will raise error, so must write indent pass kt bwh dia

#if speed < race: ERROR OF SITE TKTAu KNP TAKLE 
#pass
